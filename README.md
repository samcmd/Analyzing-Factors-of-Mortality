# Analyzing-Factors-of-Mortality
Project in R analyzing and visualizing certain factors and how they effect lifespan. Collaborated on the project with Tenju Cuddihy.


##Introduction
The data set we are analyzing was collected by the Global Health Observatory (GHO), a branch of the World Health Organization (WHO), which keeps track of worldwide health status and health factors. The data sets that the GHO oversees is made available to the public to assist with health data analysis for different countries. The data set contains information for 193 countries, the health factors being collected from the WHO’s website and the economic factors being collected from the United Nations website. 15 years of data is contained within the data set spanning the years 2000 - 2015 and covers health and economic factors that have the most effect on life expectancy.

It is unlikely that there is sampling bias within the data set as the data is collected from the WHO and the United Nations which are respected international organizations with broad reach. The data set is an observational study as the data is collected from observing patterns and trends across the world without actively introducing stimuli to analyze. This data set is incredibly interesting and important as it pertains to how certain factors effect life expectancy and can give very valuable insight into which factors most effect life expectancy and how life expectancy has changed over 15 years in any given region and across the globe.

In terms of data cleaning, the link at the top of the data set needed to be removed, descriptive columns names needed to be added, and numeric columns needed to be converted to numeric values to be properly handled by the R code.

The age at which people die is variable depending on certain factors in one’s life. One of the most important factors in determining how long a person might live is examining which country they reside in. It is also important to examine which factors heavily influence life expectancy such as diseases, wealth, education, and many other characteristics.

Afghanistan has experienced intense war and violence right around the turn of the century where the data collection begins. We would like to examine life expectancy changes in Afghanistan over a 15 year period to examine if there has been and improvement or decrease in life expectancy.

We are also interested in examining the correlation between Life Expectancy and Body Mass Index (BMI) to see if obesity or body weight have a relation with life expectancy.
